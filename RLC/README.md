# Mathcad8 - RLC

This Repository contains Mathcad 8 worksheets having to do with Resistors, Inductors and Capacitors

Description:
* CapacitanceVariationVsTempCoeffPPM.mcd - computes the variation in capacitance of a capacitor given its temperature coefficient in PPM.
* DissipationFactor.mcd - computes the dissipation factor of a capacitor given its equivalent series resistance ESR
* ESeries_RLC.mcd - Derivation of preferred RLC standard values
* ResistanceVariationVsTempCoeffPPM.mcd - computes the variation in resistance of a resistor given its temperature coefficient in PPM.
